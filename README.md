# Spotify_Song_Display
Usage of Flask and the Spotify API to display songs from a given playlist!

This is a fun project I made that takes in user authentication from Spotify and displays the playlists you can select, and from there, it displays the songs in the said playlist. I tried to make it have a song-playing functionality, but unfortunately, that is only available to Spotify Premium users.
